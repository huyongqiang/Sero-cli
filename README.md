Sero-cli provides a friendly interactive interface to help developers start developing web application on `Github`. All you need to do is pressing [KEY_UP]/[KEY_DOWN] to navigate the specific task you'd like to execute.

## Background knowledge ##
Following technologies are recommended to know before starting use it.

> [Nodejs](http://www.nodejs.org/) is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications<br/>
> [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org/) is the official package manager for `Node.js`<br/>
> [bower](http://bower.io/) works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff youâ€™re looking for<br/>

## Installation ##

```shell
npm install sero-cli -g
```

## Basic Usage ##

Move to whatever the location you want to work in.

```shell
sero
```

## Advanced Usage ##

Advanced user may love specifying the task directly without choosing them from UI. We provide the command line to achieve this.


```shell
sero [command] [options]
```

For example:

```shell
sero git -u testuser -e test@gmail.com
```

> Above command is equivalent to `Configure git options for current working directory`

User `sero --help` to check the usage for each task
